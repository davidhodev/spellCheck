and most obvious limitation is the loss of visual context in the form of generics, sarcasm, or segmented conversations. However, due to the usage of research papers and formal abstracts, these shortcomings are minimized. Furthermore, natural language processing has been used before in the context of science and chemistry (Unsupervised Word Embeddings Capture Latent Knowledge from Material Science Literature).  The research paper mentioned fed generic scientific and chemical literature and found the processing able to make connections to electronegativity and property relations. This however only scratches the surface of what is capable of using neural networks to process scholarly articles. This paper focuses natural language processing to a relatively small, highly focused dataset; on the metallocene catalyst. This was done in order to generate lists of catalysts, activators, monomers, and their shared context as a way of datamining literature for previously studied chemicals and combinations. Although this is a more specific example, the underlying neural network and algorithms can be trained for any focused dataset or topic. The goals of this research were to prove the following: catalysts, activators, and monomers of zirconocene polymerizations can be chosen for specific polymerization reactions based on natural language processing of historical academic research to predict the closest chemical names to the desired property; natural language processing can be used to group chemical reagents based on the context in which theyâ€™re used in based
